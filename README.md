# Answering Business Questions
## In this project, we'll be given a task, and we'll need to:
* Write a SQL query to extract the relevant data
* Create plots where necessary to visualize the data
* Write a short paragraph, drawing conclusions and explaining the data and/or visualizations.

### We'll be working with a modified version of a database called Chinook. The Chinook database contains information about a fictional digital music shop - kind of like a mini-iTunes store. The Chinook database contains information about the artists, songs, and albums from the music shop, as well as information on the shop's employees, customers, and the customers purchases.

Reference to the Chinook database can be found at https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database
